I just write here 6 line code for read image from text.

Whenever you want you can add the image which you like you will get the text from that image.

After then you have run this program in your terminal with that location,
```
python Read-image.py
```

You can see this article via this link :- https://towardsdatascience.com/read-text-from-image-with-one-line-of-python-code-c22ede074cac

In the medium link i changed some code and getting this output well defined.

If you will use my code from my this github repo you will not get any error.
